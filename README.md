## Inspiration
Two years ago, my grandmother finally had the chance to go to hajj. Unfortunately, none of her children could go with her because of financial issues, although she needs someone to guide her because she’s illitrate in one hand and can’t talk any other language except the algerian dialect. We searched for someone who could accompany her and it was a really difficult process. We finally found an adorable person who guided my grandmother through all the hajj steps without exception. That year we discovered the power of solidarity, kindness and brotherhood in muslims communities, and my grandmother finally achieved her dream, the fifth pillar of Islam, safely. 

Each year, Saudi Arabia hosts approximately two millions pilgrims to the city of Mekkah, as this number rises, the number of missing people rises as well, not only for elder people but everyone who finds himself alone get lost in the huge wave of people that converges to Mekkah. Many of them get shoved by the crowd and find themselves away from the road they were supposed to take or couldn’t find the right step after each ritual.

To avoid these issues and improve other aspects of hajj experience we created Tayssir Kit ! 

## What it does
Tayssir Kit is a set of innovative utilities to help provide the best hajj experience for pelgrims. Our main application is : 

**Let’s Hajj together** : Connect between great people who wants to help and people who needs accompanist to do pilgrimage. The application recommends profiles using a recommendation system which finds the right person to go with by using their location, date of flight, gender, age. 

**Tayssir Kit App**: A mobile application that guide pelgrims thoughout hajj rituals by : 

GPS counting of Kaaba Tour 

Automatic notifications of Athkar (GPS) 

Saây between Safa and Marwa Guide

At the same time, the application allows users to report problems as well as traffic congestions both for pedestrians and transport means . The collected reports will help the application displaying the main congested zones on the map. 

**Data analytics :** The collected data in reports will then be analyzed and displayed in two dashboards for management purposes : 

Traffic report Dashboard 

Problem report Dashboard 

## How we built it
**Let's Hajj Together** 

1. **A web application** using tensorflow.js to build a recommendation system capable of listing a couple of persons

2. **Mobile Android Application** using Java and some APIs like Google Maps


## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we ran into in the building of our application is to code a recommendation system without data, just sample once. This got us a real issue in testing the application. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In addition to being guiness world record breakers through the participation in Al Hajj Hackathon that is considered now as the biggest Hackathon in the world in which more than three thousands designers, developers, and entrepreneurs were present. So like any other team in this huge hackathon our goal was to put a technological touch to the pilgrimage and improve the hajj experience of each pilgrim. 

According to the idea that we've explained above we are really proud that we've been able to build a lot of features in our networking application that constitute the main idea of our project. Also we've started developing the Hajj guide application and also dashboards to give information about traffic as well as problem reports during the Hajj period. Finally we think that achieving this level in thirty six hours without stopping is a great job especially when you remember that our project contains a kit of applications and not only one ! 

## What we learned
The participation to this great event was amazing. We've never had the chance to work on a project with such an impact and such an importance. Being mentored by a group of professionals, our team had improved a lot and acquired many skills such as withstanding stress, coordinating with others, and managing a project from the start to the end.

Technically we've learned how to build a recommendation system using Tensorflow, we've integrated it in our application for a best connection between elders who need help and youth who want to be volunteers. 

## What's next for Tayssir Kit 
The next step for Tayssir Kit is to add features so as the family of the elder and those with certain needs can follow all the steps that are done by him each day.

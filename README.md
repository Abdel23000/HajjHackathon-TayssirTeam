## Inspiration
2 years ago, my grandmother finally had the chance to go to hajj. Unfortunately, none of her children could go with her because of financial issues, although she needs someone to guide her because she’s illitrate in one hand and can’t talk any other language except the algerian dialect. We searched for someone who could accompany her and it was a really difficult process. We finally found an adorable person who guided my grandmother through all the hajj steps without exception. That year we discovered the power of solidarity, kindness and brotherhood in muslims communities, and my grandmother finally achieved her dream, the fifth pillar of Islam, safely. 
Each year, Saudi Arabia hosts approximately 2 million pilgrims to the city of Mekkah, as this number rises, the number of missing people rises as well, not only for elder people but everyone who finds himself alone get lost in the huge wave of people that converges to Mekkah. Many of them get shoved by the crowd and find themselves away from the road they were supposed to take or couldn’t find the right step after each ritual.
To avoid these issues and improve other aspects of hajj experience we created Tayssir Kit !
